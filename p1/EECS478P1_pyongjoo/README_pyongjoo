1. Functions Dependencies:

* Left <- [Right]: Left function depends on the functions in Right

Apply <- [Pos_coFactor, Neg_coFactor]
Boolean_Diff <- [Apply, Pos_coFactor, Neg_coFactor]
Sort_by_Influence <- [Boolean_Diff]

All the functions follows canonically textbooks, and are taken into care to
reduce the redundancies of the code.


2. Probability Update Rule:

(Parent's prob) = 0.5 * (left's prob) + 0.5 * (right's prob)
